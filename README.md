## ðŸŒŸ Self-Motivated

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m a self-taught developer who is proficient at self-study and problem-solving.</li>
  <li>As soon as I joined the company, I took charge of all frontend projects as the sole frontend developer.</li>
  <li>I took the initiative to fully take responsibility for the project when the backend developer suddenly left.</li>
</ul>

## ðŸŒŸ Fast-Learner

<ul>
  <li>When I only learned frontend development, I quickly picked up backend development (node.js + express, mongoDB + mongoose, AWS) to create a simple online mall for my friend and completed the project on time. </li>
  <li>When I had only studied React.js, I found out that the company I was joining used Vue.js. So, I quickly learned Vue.js in the two weeks before joining. As soon as I started working, I fully took charge of frontend development.</li>
  <li>I took the initiative to fully take responsibility for the project when the backend developer suddenly left. Since the project was using SQL+Sequelize, I quickly learned them and completed the project as a full-stack developer.</li>
</ul>
